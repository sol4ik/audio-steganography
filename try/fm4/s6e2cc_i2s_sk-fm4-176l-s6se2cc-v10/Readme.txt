FM4 I2S project

This I2S project uses the SGTL5000 audio codec of the SK-FM4-216-ETHERNET
board to play a short sound.
MFS14 is used for I2C communication to the SGTL5000.
The I2S peripheral is set to slave mode, because the codec's PLL is used for
the I2S clocks (I2SCLK and I2SMCLK).

Note, that for ARM uVision the 32K limited version cannot be used.
